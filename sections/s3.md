# [S3 Fundamentals](../README.md)

## Overview

* `Buckets` (~directories) are storing `objects` (~files)
* Buckets' name must be globally unique
* S3 is a regional service
* Naming conventions
	* No uppercase
	* No underscore
	* 3-63 characters long
	* Not an IP
	* Must start with lowercase letter or number
* `Objects` have a key
	* The key is the full path
* There is no concept of directories (but in the UI does look like it)
* `ObjectValues`
	* Content of the body
	* Max size is 5 TB
	* If file is larger than 5 GB, must use `multi-part upload`
* `Metadata`
	* Key-Value pairs
* `Tags`
	* Key-value pairs
	* Maximum 10 tags
* `VersionID`
* Open a file
	* Right click -> Open: Uses correct permissions
	* Object link -> Access denied (as it is a public link)

##  Versioning basics

* Have to enable at bucket settings
* Same key overwrite will increment version, and it will keep all versions
* Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have `Version ID: null`
* Deleting a versioned file: __Adds a delete marker__, won't delete previous versions 

## Encryption for objects

* Methods
	* `SSE-S3`
		* Using AWS S3 managed keys, handled by AWS seamlessly
		* Object encrypted at server side
		* AES-256
		* Must set header when uploading: `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"`
	* `SSE-KMS`
		* KMS to manage encryption keys
		* Similar to SSE-S3, just using KMS managed keys instead of S3
		* Advantages:
			* User control
			* Audit trail
		* Must set header when uploading: `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms"`
		* Still seamless
	* `SSE-C`
		* You manage your encryption keys
		* Data keys are fully managed by the customer
		* S3 won't store the keys
		* HTTPS must be used
		* Encryption keys must be provided in the header for every request! 
		* Still seamless
	* `Client side encryption`
		* Client library such as AWS S3 Encryption Client
		* Clients must encrypt the data themselves before uploading to S3
		* Clients must decrypt the data themselves after downloading from S3
		* Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
* Encryption at transit (__SSL/TLS__)
	* `HTTP endpoint`: not encrypted
	* `HTTPS endpoint`: encrypted
* Can set bucket option to encrypt all files even if the files doesn't specify encryption

## Security

* User based
	* __IAM policies__
* Resource based
	* __Bucket policies__ (bucket wide rules)
		* Allows cross account access
	* Object Access Control List (Object ACLs): finer grain access control
	* Bucket Access Control List: less common
* Networking
	* Supports VPC endpoints (Instances in VPC without internet access can still use S3)
* Logging and Audit features
	* S3 access logs can be stored in another S3 bucket
	* API calls can be logged in CloudTrail
* User security
	* MFA required can be required to delete versioned buckets
	* Signed URLs: URL that valid only for a limited time

### Bucket policy

* JSON based
	* `Resources`: Buckets or objects
	* `Actions`: Set of API actions
	* `Effect`: Allow or Deny
	* `Principal`: Account or user to apply the policy to
* Can do various things using it:
	* Cross account access
	* Force encryption on objects
	* Grant public access
* [AWS Bucket policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html)
## Static website

* Can host static website
* Form
	* `<bucket_name>.s3-website.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
	* `<bucket_name>.s3-website-<aws_region>.amazonaws.com`
* If you get `403` -> Make sure bucket policy allows __Public read__ on the bucket!
* Properties -> Enable static website
	* Set index document
* Permissions -> Public access settings
	* Enable public access
* Set bucket policy to allow public read

## CORS

* Cross Origin Resource Sharing
* If you request data from another S3 bucket, need to set CORS
* Allows to limit the number of websites that can request your files (~limits your costs)

## Consistency model

* __Read after Write consistency for PUTs of new objects__
	* As soon as the object is written, we can access it
		* `PUT 200` -> `GET 200`
	* Except!
		* `GET 404` -> `PUT 200` -> `GET 404`, but eventually will be consistent
* __Eventual consistency for DELETEs and PUTs of existing objects__
	* Might get older version after updating it
		* `PUT 200` -> `PUT 200` -> `GET 200` (might be older version)
		* `DELETE 200` -> `GET 200`
